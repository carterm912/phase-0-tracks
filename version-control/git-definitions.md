# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* Version control is a repository of files that allows you to track and manage different versions of a file. It is useful because it lets us see what changes have been made to the file over the course of its history and allows us to revert changes if we want to.
* What is a branch and wh y would you use one?
* a branch is a seperate version of a file that is created so that people can work on it or add new code to it without touching the master file until they are done. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit saves changes of a file in git ad is accompanied by a commit message, a user who did the changes, and a timestamp. A good commit message should be very specific about what sort of changes have been done to the file. 
* What is a merge conflict?
* A merge conflict is when a branch of a file cannot me merged back into the main or master branch because of changes that the master branch has gone throuh since the feature-branch was created.
